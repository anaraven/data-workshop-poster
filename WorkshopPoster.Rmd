## Introduction to R
Do you have lots of data and don't know how to handle it?

Do you want to learn R for fun and science?

Let's meet each week to speak and learn together.

### What is needed?
a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r wordcloud}
library(RColorBrewer)
library(wordcloud)
w <- read.delim("keywords.txt", header=FALSE, as.is=TRUE, col.names="words")
pal <- brewer.pal(nrow(w), "Dark2")
wordcloud(w$words, 50-nchar(w$words)-1:nrow(w)*3, rot.per=0.4, colors=pal[-1],
          random.order=FALSE, random.color=TRUE, fixed.asp=TRUE)
```
